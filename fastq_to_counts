#Example command line for converting fastq files to counts_matrix.txt


#Packages used (fastp, hisat2, samtools, subread) 
#Recommended: (install packages in miniconda env.)


#sample input 1, use fastp for trimming 2 reads
User@User-MacBook-Pro miniconda3 % fastp -i paired_read_1.fastq.gz -I paired_read_2.fastq.gz -o trimmed_R1.fastq.gz -O trimmed_R2.fastq.gz --detect_adapter_for_pe


#sample input 2, use hisat2 to align reads create .sam file
#this step takes a while (.sam becomes very large, make sure you have enough computer space becomes ~10 original fastq file size)
#download reference genome and annotated reads from hisat2
User@User-MacBook-Pro miniconda3 % hisat2 -x reference_genome_index -1 trimmed_R1.fastq.gz -2 trimmed_R2.fastq.gz -S aligned_reads_1.sam


#sample input 3, aligned reads .bam file
User@User-MacBook-Pro miniconda3 % samtools view -bS aligned_reads_1.sam > aligned_reads_1.bam


#sample input 4, samtools to sort .bam
User@User-MacBook-Pro miniconda3 % samtools sort aligned_reads_1.bam -o sorted_aligned_reads_1.bam


#sample input 5, -p paired ends, -B make sure its read pairs even in single bam file, Mus_musculus reference genome (downloaded from hisat2)
User@User-MacBook-Pro miniconda3 % featureCounts -a Mus_musculus.GRCm39.109.chr.gtf.gz -o counts_matrix_1.txt -p -B -C sorted_aligned_reads_1.bam
