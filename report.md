### RNA Sequencing (Adv. Machine Learning Methods Final Project) Report

#### Abstract

The main objective of this project is to develop a user-friendly pipeline that can be easily utilized by researchers in our laboratory, 
even those with limited to no experience at all. By providing a general framework and clear guidelines, we aim to empower researchers to 
conduct RNA-seq analysis on their own, enabling them to explore the rich insights hidden in gene expression data. In the following sections, 
we provide a comprehensive introduction to RNA sequencing, its underlying principles, and its wide-ranging applications in various fields. 
We emphasize the uniqueness of our dataset and size (~50 gb of raw reads in fastq.gz files) and its relevance to our research goals, highlighting
the experimental nature of the data and its potential to unveil novel findings. Overall, this project not only contributes to the advancement of 
RNA-seq analysis but also has the potential to make a significant impact by providing a valuable tool for researchers in our laboratory and beyond. 
By simplifying the analysis process and enabling researchers to uncover valuable insights from their gene expression data, we strive to facilitate 
further discoveries and advancements in our research domain.
